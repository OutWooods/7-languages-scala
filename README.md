## What is this?

This is week three from the book '7 Languages in 7 weeks'. In it you learn 7 languages...in seven weeks. 
Week 4 is Scala.

Each of my folders for this book follow a similar structure. There are 'dumps' where I just put largely unformatted notes down as I go. There are 'anki' files which contain questions and answers for me to memorise and there are 'questions' files which are where I do the exercises from the book and add annotations to the code. 

I tried to follow a cycle of learn (aka the dump files), do (the questions files) and then memorise (the anki files). 

Then each week I write up some notes on learning the language, what its taught me, and also write an article on learning - linking what I experienced doing this to research on how memory actually works. 

## Why seven languages

A common (and in my view) right approach to novice coders is to learn one language and learn it well. This is great, but now I've got slightly more experienced, I think going from a more indepth approach to a breadth focused approach can help you understand the percularities of the language you've learnt - especially those you never learnt. 

For me, I've only worked with OO design styles in imperative languages (JS, PhP and Ruby). And I like this paradigm, but I cannot truely say its the best because I've tried no other approches. I also don't think you can understand the design principals behind ruby unless you see what's different - there are lots of things I probably assume about how languages work, because thats how ruby/php/js do it which are not the case. 

So the jarring nature of dealing with totally different approaches, but also subtly different ones too, is about opening up and spotting these things.

This is also about me testing out my approach to learning.

## Why this approach to learning?

My reason for doing it this way is I want to learn more efficient and effective ways to learn code. Often I've found I've learnt something, done it well and then months later its basically all gone. The anki cards slow down my pace, but that improve my long term retention. The reflections are also about that - helping me to summarise my learning (and to link it to other things I've learnt). 

Both these are ways to improve my memory. Anki is spaced repetition (article coming). Whilst the summaries are a way for me to build more long term connections - which in turn both improves my memory of these languages, but also helps me build up a wider schema of how coding languages work. A schema can be seen as a connected set of ideas and facts in a topic area (or domain). 

And this follows the school of thought that learning is heavily based on knowledge, and the more knowledge you have, the more quickly you can pick up new knowledge - because you have a pre-existing schema to fit ideas into.

So I want to see if learning all these languages, their principals and ideas, makes me better at picking up new ideas, and more flexible in my approach. 

The articles on learning are a way for me to think about how we learn to code, and connect that back to what research actually says about learning to code. And hopefully make me consider how to better teach it too. I'd like in the long term to build some sort of course for newbies, which focuses more on understanding and knowledge - and see if this helps new programmers more than perhaps classic coding curriculumns.
