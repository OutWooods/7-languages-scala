One thign discussing with a few more senior developers - is how they learn something new?

This is a bit random but I was thinking about this as I start scala, but also whilst doing piano practise. 

I was on a new piano, so I started doing scales. Whenever I go on a new piano or keyboard, I start with scales. 

Why? Well, I know them so well, they are automatic. I don't really even have to think. And it means I can start getting a feel for the piano, how heavy is it? Am I seated properly? I know what scales feel like on lots of pianos, and so its an easy point of comparisson.

And this fits with how alot of seniors I've talked to learn a new language/projects/appraoch. They often do the same task/tasks. 

So poker or sudoku or a set of puzzles. They will try and implement it in their given language/approach. If its a framework, the classic - make a todo list or make a facebook/instagram.

So why is this done and is this a good approach?

Well, the advantage is twofold

1. By doing the same task, its easy to spot contrasts between different languages. The more you do, the more you can see the advantages/disadvantages of each. 

2. It reduces your cognitive load. If you do a task you're familiar with, you don't have to think about the plan. E.g. you don't have to think about the todo list design etc. You can just focus on the learning to code. 

 But they also pointed out, often these tasks have multiple approaches. 

Idea - maybe to an article on doing tic tac toe functionally and then also OO in the same language (E.g. scala).

Why it's hard for beginners

1. The beginner has to learn
   - The language
   - Plan the project
   - Setup 
   - The basic concepts 

The experinced developer doing the same task, has only one of these four on their mind (although setup may be a bit of a pain). But they have the patterns, the vocabulary to understand the basic concepts. Even if its just 'oh this calls an array - a list' they can quicky translated alien concepts into ones they know. 

Now there is a risk that you end up coding in one language, in another. E.g. when I first did PhP I basically did just ruby in PhP. But with conscious effort and time you can start escaping that habit. It's not even a terrible approach at first because, at some point the language will kick back - and you'll start to spot why.

When I first started I used to see all the todo list tutorials as boring, I wanted to do my own projects. And I think going too close to the tutorial risks just copying and pasting. But using them, or at least, using the problems to learn something new, and repeating that each time is a promising way for a more experienced developer to pick something up.
